    testimonial_one: "When I moved to BC, I didnâ€™t have many established contacts in the area. I have gotten to know Jane well over the last few years and have found it a productive experience every time we are preparing a submission. Jane is reliable, personable and quick to identify problems and communicate solutions. Jane works within a team oriented mindset. Her knowledge base combined with her ability to gain insight and understanding of client business specifics results in focused execution within timeline goals. These combined qualities make for efficient processing within a two-way, solution driven environment. I consider Jane to be an above average CPA."

Due to her large client base, she can tell me all kinds of case scenarios and let me better understand the tax filing process. Hiring Jane could save me a lot potential trouble. Every extra penny deserves its value! I would definitely recommend Jane to my friends and clients!"

    testimonial_three: "Jane is fantastic - fast, dependable, has incredible work ethic and knows her stuff like the back of her hand. This is my second year doing Canadian taxes with her and just like last year it was an absolute pleasure. She is super fast, accurate, responsive, and hardworking responding, to emails within minutes.
    I found Jane Zhao by browsing reviews and can confirm first hand they are 100% accurate. Do not hesitate for a moment choosing Jane as your tax accountant in Vancouver"
