    testimonial_one: A.R Hytech is a great Welding company in Vancouver. We hire
      this welding contractor to build a steel framework for a commercial building
      we were working on. The technician was very knowledgeable in reading drawings and
      constructing the steel framework for the commercial staircase. We would highly
      recommend this company to anyone looking for a quality welding and metal fabrication company in Vancouver BC.
