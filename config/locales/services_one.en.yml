    service_one_header: Arc Welding
    service_one_content: Arc welding is a type of welding that uses a power supply
      to create an electric arc between an electrode and the material to melt the
      metals at that welding point. They can use either direct or alternating current,
      and consumable or non-consumable electrodes to complete each project.
    service_two_header: Structural Steel
    service_two_content: Transforming massive steel beams and sheets into fully fabricated
      components ready to be fitted into a structure requires a number of precision
      steps. At every juncture, Structural Steel Services adheres to the highest standards
      to make sure that we exactly meet the clientâ€™s specifications.
    service_three_header: Stick Welding
    service_three_content: Stick welding is a form of welding that uses electricity
      to melt a metal filler rod/electrode/stick (electrode is the proper term) that
      melts both the metal joint and electrode all at once to fuse two pieces of metal
      together and fill the joint with filler metal at the same time.
    service_four_header: Plasma cutting
    service_four_content: Plasma cutting is a process that cuts through electrically
      conductive materials by means of an accelerated jet of hot plasma. Typical materials
      cut with a plasma torch include steel, stainless steel, aluminum, brass and
      copper, although other conductive metals may be cut as well.
