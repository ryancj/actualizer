    testimonial_one: 'Jacqueline Small is diligent, professional, and
    compassionate. She went above and beyond when I was injured in a motor
    vehicle accident. Anytime I had questions she would respond quickly and
    always seemed to be one step ahead. I called several accident law firms and
    none were as knowledgeable and sincere as Jacqueline. Highly recommended!'
